Great question! Let’s break this down.

### What is a ternary representation?
Ternary (or base 3) is a way of representing numbers using only the digits **0, 1, and 2** — similar to how binary uses 0 and 1, and decimal uses 0 to 9.

### What does "sum of powers of 3" mean?
This means expressing a number as a sum of terms like:
\[
3^0, 3^1, 3^2, 3^3, \ldots
\]
For example, \(10\) could be written as:
\[
10 = 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0 = 9 + 3 + 1
\]
This is a sum of powers of 3, where each power is used at most once.

### The Rule Explained
The statement:
> "The number cannot be represented as a sum of powers of 3 if its ternary presentation has a 2 in it"

This is talking about something called the **Balanced Ternary System** or **Ternary Representation for Sums of Powers of 3**.

- In ternary (base 3), digits are allowed to be **0, 1, or 2**.
- But if you want to express a number as a sum of powers of 3 **without repeating powers** (i.e., each power of 3 can only be used 0 or 1 times), then **the ternary representation of the number should not contain the digit "2".**

### Why?
- If you see a **2** in ternary, it means you would need **two copies of the same power of 3** (like \(2 \times 3^k\)), which breaks the "each power used at most once" rule.
- Instead of \(2 \times 3^k\), you would need to "carry over" into higher powers to make it fit the sum-of-powers form.

### Example
#### Number 5
The ternary representation of 5 is:
\[
5_{10} = 12_3
\]
This has a "2", so 5 **cannot be represented as a simple sum of distinct powers of 3**.

#### Number 10
The ternary representation of 10 is:
\[
10_{10} = 101_3
\]
This has only 0s and 1s, so 10 **can** be represented as:
\[
10 = 3^2 + 3^0
\]
---

### In short
✅ If the ternary representation only has 0s and 1s → It **can** be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 3.

❌ If the ternary representation has a 2 → It **cannot** be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 3.
